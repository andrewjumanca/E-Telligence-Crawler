# E-Telligence-Crawler

was designed as part of a capstone project for the University of Washington Information School featuring NetPrism LLC, an e-commerce solutions start up. The purpose of this project was to perform web-crawling in a fashion different than how most modern search engines crawl the web for product related information.
