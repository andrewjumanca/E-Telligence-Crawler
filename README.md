# E-Telligence-Crawler
Crawlee/Scrapee-based search engine with custom parameterization and result sortation.
We are still developing our search enginee and trying to add integration between our webcrawlers and a backend

In order to run our code we have a working crawler in the crawlee_web_crawler folder.
1. Clone our repository
2. Navigate to ```crawlee_web_crawler``` in your terminal
3. Type ```npm i``` in order to install our the required dependencies
4. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, verify by typing ```node -v``` which should give your Node's version
5. Lastly run ```node app``` to run the ```app.js``` file.
6. Within ```app.js``` you can change the constant called ```url``` to any other url you would like to start your crawling process from.
